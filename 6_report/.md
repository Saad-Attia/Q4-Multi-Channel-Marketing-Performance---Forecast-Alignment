# **Phase 5 — Insights & Recommendations**

This phase delivers the complete analytical interpretation of all findings from the Executive Summary, Channel Performance, Campaign Insights, Forecasting, and Product Impact dashboards.  
Below is the full structured documentation written in a professional analytics style.

# **5.1 Performance Insights**

## **1. Channel-Level Insights**
- **All channels show nearly identical POAS (~0.45)**, indicating a balanced but *not highly profitable* acquisition strategy.
- **LinkedIn and Facebook achieve the lowest CPA (~18.8–18.9)**, making them the most cost-efficient channels.
- **Google delivers the highest total revenue** but at a slightly higher CPA, suggesting strong conversion volume but moderate efficiency.
- **TikTok maintains strong CTR and CVR**, which positions it as a high-intent channel despite slightly higher spend variability.

**Conclusion:**  
No single channel is massively outperforming the others, but there are clear *efficiency and intent leaders* worth targeted budget increases.

---

## **2. Campaign-Level Insights**
- Top-performing campaigns reached **POAS above 0.47**, significantly higher than the dataset baseline.
- The **bottom campaigns fall below 0.10 POAS**, signaling severe spend inefficiency.
- Several campaigns spent **over 113M–116M** with very little revenue return.
- Daily patterns show a **major drop in spend & revenue mid-February**, matching the campaign pause/reduction period.

**Conclusion:**  
Budget distribution across campaigns is uneven, with large pockets of wasted spend concentrated in specific low-POAS campaigns.

---

## **3. Funnel Performance Insights**
- **CTR is stable** around ~9.8% with moderate peaks and dips.
- **CVR trends closely follow CTR**, meaning funnel quality is consistent but still leaves room for optimization.
- **Awareness is stronger than consideration** (0.57 avg vs 0.31 avg).  
  → This signals a **leak between awareness → consideration**.

**Conclusion:**  
Users know about the product but are not being sufficiently convinced to move deeper into the funnel.

---

## **4. Forecast Accuracy Insights**
- **MAPE is extremely high (~444%)**, indicating the forecast model is not suitable.
- Forecast error distribution shows:
  - consistent **negative bias** → model *overestimates* revenue.
  - heavily fluctuating residuals.
- Error patterns vary significantly by date, meaning the model does not adapt well to spend fluctuations.

**Conclusion:**  
The forecasting model should not be used for budget decisions in its current state. It requires redesign (features, model type, segmentation).

---

## **5. Product Impact Insights**
- Awareness and consideration **did not correlate strongly** with conversions or revenue.
- Impact score has a **weak but positive correlation** with conversions.
- Channel-level impact lift varies, with TikTok and Instagram showing better responsiveness to new creative boosts.
- No clear spike after launch → meaning the product launch impact was **muted**.

**Conclusion:**  
The product launch did not generate strong measurable lift. Messaging or targeting may not have aligned with audience needs.

# **5.2 Problems Identified**

## **1. Budget Inefficiencies**
- Heavy spend concentrated on campaigns with low POAS.
- Channels maintain similar POAS, but spend allocation does not prioritize the most efficient ones.

## **2. Forecasting Issues**
- High MAPE indicates the model is structurally broken.
- Forecast bias shows consistent over-optimistic expectations.

## **3. Funnel Weakness**
- Strong awareness, weak consideration.
- CTR is not low, but CVR shows instability during several periods.
- Drop-off before conversion indicates potential landing page or offer issues.

## **4. Product Launch Weakness**
- Impact score and funnel metrics did not significantly shift after launch.
- Awareness did not translate into higher conversions or revenue.
- Channels varied in their response, showing inconsistent creative effectiveness.

## **5. Operational Issues**
- Daily performance drops indicate budget throttling or delivery constraints.
- Spend reductions did not correlate to proportional ROI improvements.

---

# **5.3 Recommendations**

## **1. Reallocate Budget to High-Efficiency Channels**
- Increase spend on:
  - **LinkedIn & Facebook** for lowest CPA.
  - **TikTok** for strongest conversion intent.
- Reduce spend from:
  - **Google during low-impact periods** (moderate CPA + diminishing returns).

---

## **2. Optimize Campaign Portfolio**
- Pause or rebuild campaigns with **POAS < 0.20**.
- Redirect budget to the top **10 campaigns with POAS > 0.40**.
- Introduce campaign-level bid rules tied to:
  - real-time CPA thresholds  
  - marginal ROAS  
  - hourly performance curves.

---

## **3. Improve Funnel Conversion**
- Strengthen consideration stage:
  - Long-form ad creative  
  - Mid-funnel retargeting  
  - Product value propositions
- Improve CVR:
  - Landing page performance fixes  
  - Simplified checkout  
  - Personalized offers  

---

## **4. Rebuild the Forecasting Model**
Recommended model upgrade:

- Segment by channel & campaign  
- Include:
  - spend lag effects
  - product impact scores
  - seasonality patterns  
- Switch to:
  - LightGBM  
  - Prophet  
  - ARIMA (if time-series is stable)

Add monitoring:
- weekly MAPE check  
- bias correction  
- rolling retraining  

---

## **5. Strengthen Product Launch Strategy**
- Improve messaging clarity around product value.
- Test 4–6 creative variations per channel.
- Apply audience-based impact modeling:
  - Awareness responsiveness  
  - Consideration elasticity  
- Re-run launch with proper A/B structure.

---

## **6. Operational & Execution Improvements**
- Daily pacing rules to avoid mid-month performance dips.
- Automated alerts on:
  - POAS drop  
  - CTR < 0.097  
  - CVR < 8.0  
  - Forecast error spike  
- Build dashboards that refresh daily for real-time visibility.
