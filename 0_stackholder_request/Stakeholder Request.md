**Subject:** Q4 Multi-Channel Performance & Forecast Alignment Analysis  

Hi Saad,  

We need your help preparing a comprehensive analytics review for our Q4 marketing performance. Leadership is concerned about rising spend, inconsistent ROAS across channels, and whether our predictions are matching reality.

### **We need answers to the following questions:**

### **1️ Spend & Efficiency**
- Are we spending our budget efficiently across campaigns and channels?  
- Which channels are overspending vs underspending?  
- Which campaigns deliver the strongest POAS/ROAS?  
- Which ones need optimization or budget cuts?

### **2️ Performance Drivers**
- What is driving performance?  
- How do impressions, clicks, CTR, CVR vary by channel and campaign?  
- What time of the day/week gives the best performance?

### **3️ Forecast vs Actual**
- Are forecasts accurate?  
- Where are we over-performing or under-performing?  
- What periods show the largest deviation?

### **4️ Product Launch Impact**
- How has the new product influenced awareness and consideration?  
- How does this translate into clicks and conversions?  
- Which channels benefited most from the product uplift?

### **5️ Recommendations**
- Where should we increase, reduce, or reallocate spend?  
- What actions will drive higher efficiency next month?
